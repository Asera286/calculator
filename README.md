# Calculator

This is a calculator built in React using Typescript.

It utilizes the slightly more complex Pratt Parser rather than some of the more traditional methods, as I find it to be more robust and extensible. It was also just a fun challenge to implement.

It is not yet completed, I feel. While it can do all of the basic math functions, I want to add some more complex ones. I also want to improve the error handling, as currently it is rather lackluster.
